## Overview
CollecTRI is a gene regulatory network (GRN) containing signed transcription factor
(TF) - target gene interactions. TF-gene interactions were manually curated and 
collected from ExTRI, HTRI, TRRUST, TFActS, IntAct, SIGNOR, CytReg, GEREDB and 
Pavlidis. CollecTRI was benchmarked using the knockTF datasets and showed a
superior performance compared to other known GRNs.


## Data availability 

CollecTRI is available through 
[OmniPath] or the 
[DoRothEA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/dorothea.html) 
bioconductor package.
